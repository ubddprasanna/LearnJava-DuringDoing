# CyberCrewz Academy: School Management System V1
**Code Name:** River

Welcome to the **CyberCrewz Academy School Management System** project!
This project is designed as a **learning-while-building journey** to master **Java fundamentals** step by step while creating a real-world application.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a **console-based School Management System (Phase 1: Non-OOP)**.
The system starts from a tiny step (printing a welcome message) and gradually grows into a **fully functional school management tool** using **arrays, loops, conditionals, file handling, and basic object-oriented concepts**.

**Key Features in Phase 1:**
- Student Management (Add, Search, Update, Delete, Report)
- Teacher Management (Add, Search, Update, Delete)
- Library Management (Book Tracking, Borrow, Return)
- Lab & Attendance Tracking
- Data persistence using **File Handling**
- Error Handling & Debugging practices
- Step-by-step improvement from beginner to advanced concepts

---

## 🗂 Project Roadmap
The system is built in **incremental steps**. Each step introduces **new concepts and improvements**:

**Step 1:** Print welcome message
**Step 2-5:** Manage basic student information (name, age, ID)
**Step 6-10:** Introduce **Operators & Expressions** in grade calculation
**Step 11-15:** Add **loops** to manage multiple students
**Step 16-20:** Implement **arrays** for storing students, teachers, and books
**Step 21-25:** File handling: save/load student & teacher records
**Step 26-30:** Full functional system with error handling, report generation, and basic analysis

> Each step is designed to gradually **improve the previous system**, following professional engineering thinking.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By working on this project, I aim to:
- Master **Java data types, operators, loops, conditionals, arrays**
- Understand **methods, recursion, and basic OOP**
- Practice **file handling and exception handling**
- Learn how to **think like a professional developer**: identify problems, improve solutions, and structure code effectively
- Build a **real-world project** from scratch while applying **incremental improvements**

## 📂 Technologies & Concepts Covered
- **Java Basics:** Variables, Data Types, Constants, Operators
- **Control Flow:** if, switch, for, while, do-while, break, continue
- **Arrays:** 1D, 2D, traversal, copying, default values
- **Algorithms:** Searching, Sorting, Factorial, Fibonacci, Palindrome
- **File Handling:** java.io.File, FileWriter, Scanner
- **Error Handling:** try-catch, IOException, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException
- **Collections & Data Structures (Intro):** ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList
- **Math & Utilities:** java.lang.Math, Random
- **Good Practices:** Naming conventions, comments, indentation, modular coding

---

## 🎯 Future Phases
**Phase 2: OOP Refactor & Advanced Features**
- Convert to **full OOP** using classes and objects
- Introduce **inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**
- Use **collections like HashMap & ArrayList** effectively
- Optional: GUI or Database Integration
